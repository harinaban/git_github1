in 2009 - devops coined
developers and operation together,
Infrastructure as code
Google started in 2004,borg
puppet-->chef-->ansible--configuration management system(infrastructure configuation to network config to
application config database,installing and configuring everything)
Docker ->  but docker will come ready with all the above things,prebuilt,
Kubernetes -> google cloud-->used for running docker(seven of nine)
github running on Kubernetes
spinnaker - deploy the product on multiple cloud in multiple regions(hybrid cloud deployment tool)

five pillar of Devops
Cloud - AWS,AZURE,GLOUD Cloud
containers - Docker + kubernetes (application with standard format as docker offers it can work the same way
in laptop,datacenter environment,cloud..),docker offers 2 things define standard format + runtime to take that package and run in isolated environ
Kubernetes help you to run application in multiple servers with one logical entity uses: scale your application,load balancing,high availability
IAAC - Ansible,terraform,(create infrastructure(cloud provisioning ) top of AWS,AZURE
CI/CD - Jenkins(pipeline as a code)+docker will provide clean and disposable environment
observability - Infer the state of the system,tools to infer the issues based on  data,
        3 practices-Logs,metrics,traces(how flow between one service to another can be funneled by traces)
        makes application and infrastructure more observable
        logs - elasticsearch,logstash-collects the logs,index it and visualize it,
        metrics-prometheus(time series database with multiple dimension,grafana-visualizer)
        traces - jaeger,zipkin
