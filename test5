for new file addition and deletion we have to use all 3 steps

git restore file name -- only restore if files not  staged ie before using add .
git add filename--<add the modification to staging area
git restore --staged filename -- to unstage the files
git restore filename

git commit -m "msg for commit"--commit all the changes to local git folder
git push origin branch name---pushes to git hub

to recover deleted file
git rev-list HEAD -n 2 -- test3 -->displays 2 commit where the file last changed, select 2nd commit
git show commit -->wil display the commit action performed
git checkout 2nd commit^ filename or .
git commit -m "msg"
git push

git add .  ->to add all modification

git remote add origin https://github.com/harinaban/git_github1.git --> to add/connect the github to local
git remote -v ->displays all origin and upstream link attached to this project
git remote add upstream <upstream link which was forked>

git branch -->to display parent branch
git branch -M master -->to change main branch name before commiting anything
after that if we use git branch -M master1 then new branch will be created

git branch master2 create new branch

git branch -a --.to list all the branches

git checkout master1 ->to move to another branch and move the head

git diff master1 ->to give the difference between 2 branches and q to exit

git merge master1--currently at master branch

git pullrequest only available in github,to merge from another branch where main branch merge access is not available

conflicts arised by pullrequest should be resolved by manually 

github1s will open the github in visual code

states
untracked - new file
modified - existing file changes done

git log to view the modification and commit history

git reset commit hash-->to restore to a particular version of project


git stash --> to keep the changes but not want to commit
git stash pop --> to bring the changes back
git stash clear -->to remove the uncommit/temp holding changes

fork in github used to make a copy of another repos under our repo
